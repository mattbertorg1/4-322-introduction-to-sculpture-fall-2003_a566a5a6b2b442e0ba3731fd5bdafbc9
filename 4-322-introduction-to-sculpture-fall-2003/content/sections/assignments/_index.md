Three major projects will be given during the course of the semester, along with smaller projects interspersed throughout. The assignment for the first project is detailed in this section. The second and third projects will follow from the first, and should be an outgrowth of that work. Individual consultations between the student and the instructors help to flesh out the goals and requirements of the second and third projects.

**First Assignment**: Floppy and Sturdy, Skins and Structures ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/pro1fall03))
